Technical Interview Exercise

Your task is to develop a simple web application with an API and data layer using .NET C#, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and a database or data store, while adhering to Clean Architecture principles and using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies.

Your development should be driven by an informal user story that you will create, and which should be included in your presentation. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete records from the data via the API endpoints. Additionally, you should create a user, login as the user, and ensure that the user information is stored in the data.
 
To showcase your ability to work with modern data storage systems you cannot use Entity Framework, Dapper, or Mediator to complete this assignment.
