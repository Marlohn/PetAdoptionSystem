# Pet Adoption System

## Description
The Pet Adoption System is designed to streamline the process of pet adoption. It offers a platform for animal shelters to list pets available for adoption and for potential adopters to view and adopt these pets.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core**: For building the API and the main backend services.
- **SQL Server**: For the database management.
- **xUnit**: For unit testing.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used.

### User Story: Manage Pets and Users in the Adoption System
As an administrator, I want to be able to manage the pet adoption system by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting pet records and user accounts. Additionally, I need to ensure secure login and authorization for different operations so that the data integrity and security of the system are maintained.
